## Introduction

This repository contains Python scripts for performing several fundamental image processing tasks. The scripts utilize NumPy for numerical operations and matplotlib for visualizations.

## Functionality

### Image Patches

Extracts patches from an input image and normalizes them based on their mean and standard deviation.

### Convolution

Implements convolution with zero-padding using custom functions for correctness verification.

### Edge Detection

Performs edge detection using both Sobel operators and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filters.

### Sobel Operator

Applies Sobel operators to compute gradients and gradient magnitudes of an input image.

### Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) Filter

Applies LoG filters to detect edges and points of interest in an image.

Each function is implemented in a modular way within the `main.py` script, demonstrating various image processing techniques.
## Usage

To run the game use:

```
python filters.py
```
You must the image in the same folder with the filters.py
